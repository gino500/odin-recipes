      Old-fashioned breaded chicken cutlets! This traditional recipe for chicken
      cutlets is a labor of love, but they are well worth the effort
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (4oz) boneless, skinless chicken breast. 1/2 inch thickness</li>
      <li>1/2 cup salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>8 slices crustless bread, torn into large pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dried parsley</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>3/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Step 1</b>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place a large
        oven-proof plate on the bottom rack
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 2</b>Dissolve salt and sugar in water in a 1-quart casserole
        dish. Place chicken in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 30
        minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 3</b>Pat chicken dry and place on a paper towel-lined baking
        sheet. Let air-dry for 10 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 4</b>Place bread in a blender or food processor; blend until
        crumbly, about 30 seconds. Mix bread crumbs with parsley in a shallow
        dish
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 5</b>Place flour in a shallow dish</li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 6</b>Beat eggs with 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate shallow
        dish
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 7</b>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge each cutlet in
        the flour, shaking off any excess; dip in the egg mixture and coat
        evenly in bread crumbs
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 8</b>Heat the remaining oil in a nonstick skillet over medium
        heat. Add 2 cutlets; cook until golden brown on the outside, no longer
        pink in the center, and juices run clear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove warmed plate from the oven; placed
        cooked cutlets on the plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken
      </li>
    </ul>
